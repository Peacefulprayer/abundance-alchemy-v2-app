# RUNBOOK

## Quick Start
1. `python tools/project_doctor.py`
2. Fix failures per Summary hints.
3. Commit small, focused PRs; keep CI green.

## Conventions
- Conventional Commits; auto-changelog on release.
- Keep layout/content in components + MDX/config; no duplication.
- Add tests for every bug fix.
